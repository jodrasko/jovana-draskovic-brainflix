// Troubleshooting

/*
  EADDRINUSE: address already in use :::8080
  means you already have something running on 8080
*/

/*
  To stop your server from running, press Ctrl+C
*/

/*
  Cannot set headers after they are sent to the client
  You are trying to send a response after the response has already been sent. You can only send ONE response per request
*/
